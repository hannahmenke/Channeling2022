Supplementary material for PNAS paper Menke Maes Geiger 2022

The DrawMicromodelsPNAS.ipynb file is a python notebook for drawing the micromodels found in Menke et al. 2022. This code makes micromodels of a set spacing, offset, radius, and random deviation in the x y coordinates. The script will create 12 models with the same statistics, but different arrangements due to the random deviation. The files are saved to the .hdf5 format with the location and radius of each grain so that they can be recreated or adjusted as needed. 

The original images for model A and B can be found on our Zenodo archive 10.5281/zenodo.6993528. 

Example input stacks for the models are here. 

The entire output of the models can be found on our Zenodo archive 10.5281/zenodo.6993528.
